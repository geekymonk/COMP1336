## About the Class

CS 151 is an introductory class designed for students with no formal exposure to computer science or programming. The goal is to provide a gentle but thorough introduction to computer science that will prepare students to either take further computer science courses, or use computer science in their field of study.

See the [Syllabus page](syllabus.md) for more details on course policies.
